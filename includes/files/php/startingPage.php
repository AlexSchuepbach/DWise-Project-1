    <h2 class="redTitle">About us</h2>

    <div class="aboutUs">

        <p>Welcome to OUI We are glad to have you around us. OUI is a place for all. We have been in existence for about
            8
            years. Our café use to be a grab-and-go style with less interaction with our customers.
            We have decided to take our café to the next level, a place to be and a place of relaxation. A place of
            meeting
            friends and a place of chilling.
            OUI is a place to enjoy a homemade coffee in a traditional French style.</p>
